# Instapages Project_2 NYt API
 
-The instages project is a a project in which I got the opportunity to figure out how to use an API, JSON, JQuery, Sass and Gulp. 

## Getting Started
-To start click index.html in folder directory or open folder in Visual Studio Code and run 'gulp' in console.
-Select from the drop down menu below "Choose a section".
- Select the Section which you are interested in viewing.
-Select an item to verify that it is linking properly to the New York Times website.

### Features
- The Project allows the user to scan through the top stories section of the New York Times Website. 
-The Web page titled New York Times API is connected to the main sites webpage but without the overwhelming visual noise of the main site.
-A user can select between 6 different sections of Top Stories and see 12 stories appear in their browser.
-The site also features a customized loading gif





### Installing



## Running the tests

-The Web inspector was used throughout the project to ensure that the site was responsive at various media sizes.

-The list items that are generated from user's selection serve as links to the corresponding New York Time's webpage as the image is a link!
